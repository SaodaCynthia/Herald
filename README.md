# Herald

Herald is a solar energy harvesting room number transmitter BLE beacon. It has been tested and deployed in 3 different indoor settings: a lab space with sunlight , indoor office with only indoor lights and an industrial steam plant with indoor lights. This project shows that solar energy harvesting beacons has promising future in indoor settings and performance can be further improved with planned deployment of beacons and a minimum indoor light intensity level.
